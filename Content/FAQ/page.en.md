# FAQ - Frequently Asked Questions
### About RWAI Arena

#### What is Real-World AI?
Real-World AI is an academic open-source project focused on AI implementation in real-world scenarios. Currently, it primarily shares best practice cases for solving various AI implementation problems in real-world scenarios through open-source code, documentation, and associated resource links. The project is currently in beta, and we welcome your trial and feedback.

#### What is the Real-World AI Arena? Why evaluate best practices through an "Arena"?
In the process of AI implementation, we most often encounter two questions: How can I solve the problem in my scenario with AI, and how to quickly verify the results? What solution is best/most suitable for me? We take some common scenarios of AI implementation as "Arenas", continuously searching for best practices (SOTA) amid evolving AI technologies and applications, and selecting "champions" for specific scenarios. Through "Tsinghua Select", we solve the problems of technology selection and trial-and-error costs. Real-world AI implementation evaluation criteria are complex and difficult to have absolute scores like academic benchmarks, so we don't rank, only comprehensively evaluate best practices.

#### What problems does Real-World AI solve? How is it different from other open-source projects like GitHub and Huggingface?
Currently, AI-related open-source communities have rich open-source ecosystems, mainly focusing on code open-sourcing and practice sharing. However, AI implementation is a complex and enormous project, with core difficulties in human-AI interaction and practice, including: business requirement guidance and refinement, expert knowledge input, technical solution design, business application processes, etc. Therefore, having only AI technology or code is not enough. We attempt to model and restore the "Human-in-the-Loop" (HITL) system of AI implementation, ensuring verifiability, practicability, and replicability, completing the "last mile" of AI implementation.

### Resources and Users

#### What resources can I get from Real-World AI?
You can understand, participate in, and share various best practice solutions for real-world scenarios based on the latest AI technologies in Real-World AI.

#### Who are the user groups of Real-World AI? Can I use it if I'm not a programmer or don't understand algorithms?
Real-World AI aims to help as many partners as possible related to AI implementation get help and participate in co-construction. Leaders and decision-makers can understand the latest technology development trends and real cases in industrial applications. Business experts can understand, reference, and practice the full process of rapid AI implementation in their own industries. Technical developers can understand and replicate the actual effects and best cases of latest technologies applied in different scenarios. Even without understanding algorithms or knowing how to write code, you can find many low-barrier, zero/low-code practice solutions.

### Best Practices

#### How do you define and evaluate "best practices"?
As a team that has been doing industrial AI practice work for a long time, we believe that best practices for real-world AI should first start from the goals of real-world scenarios, clearly defining the value that AI implementation can bring to the industry, such as: compliance and security, organizational adaptability, system adaptability as basic requirements, and of course business effect, implementation cost, implementation cycle as effect indicators. In industrial AI practice, we will choose some representative and universal scenarios with clear interfaces to common systems, define the business effect indicators of this scenario, and look for best practices.
