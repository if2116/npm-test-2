## 2. Basic Information

### 2.1 Overview

**Market Context**: Intelligent research tasks are widely used in competitive research, supervision and review, training and learning in industries such as finance & trade, consulting management, public policy, marketing, and enterprise operations. They have broad usage demand and extremely high frequency.

**Solution**: Based on user-input research topics and keywords, this system automatically collects relevant materials, performs knowledge extraction and integration through intelligent processes, and finally generates and outputs research documents according to preset templates.



### 2.2 Classification Tags

**Industry Categories**: Information Technology, Science & Education, Finance & Trade

**Application Categories**: Service, Operations, Management

**Technology Categories**: Large Language Model (LLM), Natural Language Processing (NLP), Agent, Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG), Text Generation



### 2.3 Implementation Cycle

- **Demo R&D**: 3.5-5 days



### 2.4 Team Composition

- **Demo Stage**: 1 Business Expert, 1 Algorithm Engineer



### 2.5 Business Pain Points

- **Low Manual Research Efficiency**: Completing a complete research report (such as industry research report, due diligence report, etc.) with professional knowledge usually takes 1-3 weeks for data collection, organization, analysis, and writing
- **Difficult Information Integration**: Facing massive information sources, manual screening and integration easily miss important content, and it's difficult to ensure information accuracy and timeliness
- **Inconsistent Report Formats**: Different personnel and institutions have great differences in writing styles and layout requirements, affecting report standardization and consistency
- **High Update and Maintenance Costs**: The market environment changes rapidly, manually updating and maintaining research report versions requires continuous investment; building a research team or inviting experts also requires additional costs



### 2.6 Core Functions

- **Global Data Collection**: Automatically collect relevant materials from the entire web based on user-input topics and keywords
- **Information Integration & Analysis**: Extract key information from collected candidate materials and generate insights and summaries
- **Automatic Report Generation**: Automatically generate structured research documents according to preset templates



### 2.7 Core Business Metrics

- **Single Document Research Accuracy**: Report template fit ≥95%, format standardization ≥99%, improving format revision and other processes
- **Single Document Review Time**: Reduced to ≤15 minutes (manual requires 1 week), supporting large-scale, stable batch generation
- **Single Document Labor Input Cost**: Combining the above efficiency metrics with technical metrics below, manual operation and review costs can be reduced by 95%, improving user experience



### 2.8 Core Technical Metrics

- **Single Document Research Performance Comprehensive Assessment**: DeepResearch Bench comprehensive score ≥51, ensuring generated report credibility



## 3. Best Practice Version

### 3.1 Private Deployment - Server Deployment Version

#### 3.1.1 Reasons for Best Practice Selection

**Metric Improvements**:
- This solution achieved a comprehensive score of **51.86** on the Deep Research evaluation benchmark DeepResearch Bench, ranking **#2** among all open-source available solutions as of December 24 (only 1.5% gap from #1 solution tavily-research (51.97)), ensuring generated reports are accurate and credible, improving user experience
- This solution's average report generation time is **≤15 minutes**, **33% faster** than salesforce-air-deep-research (approximately 20 minutes on average), improving research efficiency

**Cost Optimization**:
- This solution supports domestic large models such as **GLM-4.7** as the base and achieves the above performance metrics. Since domestic large model API fees are relatively lower, it saves nearly **60% in operating costs**
- This solution's generated report template fit is **≥95%**, format standardization **≥99%**, compared to manual solutions (approximately 1 week, requiring communication, research, expert consultation, proofreading, layout and other processes), labor costs are reduced by approximately **95%**
